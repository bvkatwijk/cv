            Experienced all-round Software Engineer with over ten years of professional experience.
            Together with colleagues, I like to work on new or existing technical projects.
            While I specialize in back-end web development and cloud infrastructure
            I like to use and enhance my skills on full-stack development,
            CLI development, AI, automation, and security.
            The Java ecosystem has been a central theme throughout my career,
            but I use different technologies where appropriate.
            I thrive on optimizing developer experience and building robust, scalable solutions.
            In the software field I see a great opportunity to work with passionate colleagues on
            delivering products of creativity and quality.
            I love working in an all-round team of enthusiastic people where innovation can be combined with
            best-practices to achieve
            great results.
            With over ten years of professional experience Iâ€™m always looking for ways to improve and to help others
            improve.
            I like to do this through pair programming, mentoring, hosting workshops and giving presentations on
            technical topics. <br />
            I value an informal atmosphere with room for personal development and new ideas.
            I have a bachelors degree in <a
                href="https://www.tudelft.nl/en/onderwijs/opleidingen/bachelors/technische-wiskunde/bachelor-of-applied-mathematics">Applied
                Mathematics</a>
            and I am originally self-taught in programming.
            In my spare time I study philosophy, politics, economy, sociology and history. I play piano and I enjoy
            playing board games with friends.

                        At TOPdesk I started my career as a summer intern, then was onboarded as a software engineer at
                        the Customer Solutions department,
                        building customizations into TOPdesk for large customers.
                        Projects included creating additional user interfaces, integrations with third party
                        applications or overhauling internal workflows and processes.
                        Maintaining a wide portfolio of customer solutions on top of an ever-changing base product
                        developed by around 400 developers required robust testing,
                        disciplined structure and habits, and type safety where possible to be able to detect
                        regressions and fix them before new versions of the base product went live.
                        <br />
                        We used Gradle to orchestrate customer projects on top of the base product as a compiled JAR,
                        then used predefined hooks and techniques like shadowing to create customizable behaviour,
                        hot-reloading for fast development feedback,
                        and quickly got into Docker as soon as the technology matured.

                        <br />
                        I promoted Test-Driven Development and code quality, participated in the transition to
                        Continuous Deployment, improved the usage of source control (Mercurial, Git, JIRA),
                        implemented build pipelines for many projects (Gradle, Jenkins, Docker), developed a
                        fine-tuned end-to-end testing DSL (JUnit, Selenium, Karma, Jasmine), and introduced
                        various new tools and frameworks (Scala, Angular, Kotlin, TypeScript, Sonar).

        In my spare time I like to play piano, play games with friends and go bouldering.
        I like to read about or listen to podcasts about philosophy, economics, mathematics and history.
