            Experienced all-round Software Engineer with over ten years of professional experience.
            I enjoy working with colleagues on both new and existing technical projects, specializing in back-end web
            development and cloud infrastructure while also working at full-stack development, CLI tools, AI,
            automation, and security.
            <br /><br />
            My background in
            <a
                href="https://www.tudelft.nl/en/onderwijs/opleidingen/bachelors/technische-wiskunde/bachelor-of-applied-mathematics">Applied
                Mathematics</a>
            reignited a passion for programming that started in my teenage years.
            The Java ecosystem has been a central theme throughout my career, but I use the best tools for the job,
            adapting to different technologies where needed. I like to optimize developer experience and building
            solutions for both end-users and direct colleagues. I see software development as a unique opportunity to
            collaborate with
            passionate colleagues in creating innovative, high-quality products.
            <br /><br />
            I love being part of a well-rounded, enthusiastic team where innovation and best practices come together to
            achieve great results. With over a decade of experience, I'm always looking for ways to improve and help
            others grow. I do this through pair programming, mentoring, hosting workshops, and giving technical
            presentations.
            <br /><br />
            I value an informal work environment with room for personal development and fresh ideas. Outside of work, I
            enjoy studying philosophy, politics, economics, sociology, and history. I also play the piano, like to go
            bouldering and love to play board games with friends.

                        At HeadFirst Group I was initially onboarded as a senior backend and cloud developer,
                        however since there were so many improvement opportunities I transitioned into a lead role of
                        the development team which grew from a team of 5 developers into three complete scrum teams.
                        This growth required streamlining, automation, tooling and standardization.
                        Due to company mergers the microservice landscape had grown too large and diverse to maintain
                        leading to technical
                        debt and a decrease in velocity. I asked for the green light to spend part of my time on general
                        development improvements.<br />

                        While keeping the flow of the teams I introduced steps to simplify and reduce the
                        required work. Colleagues joined in with ideating and implementing these improvements.
                        I reduced work by providing generated API clients between projects.
                        I set up SonarQube pull request decoration, automated CI/CD pipelines and fed notifications into
                        Slack.
                        I introducted distributed tracing with AWS XRay to be able to visualize performance bottlenecks,
                        administrated and standardized logging in GrayLog, set up alerts for important errors,
                        hooked up critical alerts into Slack to reduce lead time.
                        I removed all branching habits from the numerous repositories by using trunk-based development,
                        eliminating error-prone git work.
                        Not only did this require thorough design and implementation effort, but also project
                        management,
                        as well as gaining support from peers and higher level management by hosting demos,
                        presentations and feedback sessions.

                        model, designing a system to synchronize form data with calculations, and ensuring seamless
                        updates.

                        At TOPdesk I started my career as a summer intern, then was onboarded as a software engineer at
                        the Customer Solutions department,
                        building customizations into TOPdesk for large customers.
                        Projects included creating additional user interfaces, integrations with third party
                        applications or overhauling internal workflows and processes.
                        Maintaining a wide portfolio of customer solutions on top of an ever-changing base product
                        developed by around 400 developers required robust testing,
                        disciplined structure and habits, and type safety where possible to be able to detect
                        regressions and fix them before new versions of the base product went live.
                        <br />
                        We used Gradle to orchestrate customer projects on top of the base product as a compiled JAR,
                        then used predefined hooks and techniques like shadowing to create customizable behaviour,
                        hot-reloading for fast development feedback,
                        and quickly got into Docker as soon as the technology matured.
                        <br />
                        A few projects
                        <ul>
                            <li>Integration between Microsoft Exchange and TOPdesk reservations</li>
                            <li>In-application chat, simultaneous page editing requiring concurrent E2E testing</li>
                        </ul>

                        <br />
                        I promoted Test-Driven Development and code quality, participated in the transition to
                        Continuous Deployment, improved the usage of source control (Mercurial, Git, JIRA),
                        implemented build pipelines for many projects (Gradle, Jenkins, Docker), developed a
                        fine-tuned end-to-end testing DSL (JUnit, Selenium, Karma, Jasmine), and introduced
                        various new tools and frameworks (Scala, Angular, Kotlin, TypeScript, Sonar).
